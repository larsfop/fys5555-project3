## FYS5555 - Project 3

Analysis code for Higgs decay into di-photon and four lepton final states, also an attempt for the WW channel, but Higgs MC background is almost a hundred times larger than is should be and could not be bothered so ignored it for the two other channels.

Code is horribly built and not well commented, though it is only necessary to run each notebook. Should not have to run any c++ code at all. It should work in galaxy hep, haven't tested it outside, but will probably work with the required packages and setting the correct data path.
The event selection is inside the process function for each channel, it is only if tests and some calculations using either root, basic equations or the mt2 package included.

If there is anything that need mentioning or explained just ask and I will probably write some comments if necessary.

Cheer.
